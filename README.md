# Incohearent
Incohearent - Xamarin/C# Application  
Server: https://github.com/josipamrsa/IncohearentServer

From the Amazon page: "Incohearent is the adult party game that will get you talking! Let the laughs begin as you compete to make sense out of gibberish from one of three categories â€” kinky, party and pop culture."  
This is a C#/Xamarin project which is a mobile game app inspired by the card game.

## Installation (for testing purposes)

* Download the Incohearent server (link above) and run it locally or on your own server
* Download the source code for this app and open it (Visual Studio 2019)
* Make sure to pick a server configuration in app settings (preferably setup the Azure server)
  * All app settings are located in file Constants.cs
* You can debug on a physical device or emulator, or just export the APK file  

## How to play

Make sure your group is using the same WiFi network, otherwise you will not be able to see
players in your lobby. Log into the app using whichever name you want. Once all your players
are logged in, only one player should start the game (bug currently). The person that started
the game will take on a role of judge (original phrase will be displayed to him), and the rest will be earning points depending on their
answers (guessing the scrambled phrase). The game continues for as long as you want. If you wish to end the game, the judge
should stop the game.
